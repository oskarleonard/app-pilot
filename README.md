# app-pilot — agent-driven QA engines (iOS simulator + web)

Reusable "eyes & hands" for an AI agent that **operates your running app**:
reads the live accessibility tree, taps/clicks by label, screenshots, hunts
bugs, verifies its own fixes, and asserts backend ground truth the screen
can't show. No pre-written test scripts — the agent explores; these engines
are its deterministic mechanics.

One clone per machine serves every project. Fix a harness bug once, here —
every project picks it up on the next `git pull`. That replaces the old
copy-per-project workflow where improvements died in whichever repo got them.

## The layering contract

The engine is **product-agnostic**. Everything project-specific lives in the
project, layered over the engine through four well-known places in the
project's app-pilot dir (`scripts/app-pilot/`, same for mobile and web):

| Layer | File(s) | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **Pin** | `target.py` (+ gitignored `target.local`) — sim/port/bundle/mode env, server cmd | yes |
| **Ground truth & product brain** | `product/` — `app_pilot_api.py` (`app-pilot check/snapshot/diff`), `INVARIANTS.md`, `FIGMA_MAP.md`, `RUNBOOK.md` addendum (modes, rails, scopes) | no |
| **Project commands** | `ext/<name>{,.py,.sh}` — any extra subcommand (`app-pilot <name>`), e.g. an autoplay layer for timed gameplay | no |
| **Output** | `runs/` (gitignored) | auto |

`product/app_pilot_api.py` owns *whatever* the project's ground truth is — a local
REST backend, SQLite, a state-store dump. The engine only defines the CLI
contract (`check`, `snapshot --out f`, `diff f [--expect-new N]`); without the
file, those commands no-op with a notice.

A team can also keep the product layer in a dedicated repo (e.g. a central
QA-scenario repo) and point `product/` at that checkout — the engine doesn't
care where the dir comes from.

**Missions** sit on top of all of this: `missions/*.md` are job briefs
(bug-hunt, scenario-exec, ...) launched by ~10-line shims in each project's
`.claude/commands/`. One mission, N projects, zero copy drift — see
`missions/_format.md` for the schema and invocation contract.

## Install (once per machine)

Clone **anywhere you like**, then pin the clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oskarleonard/app-pilot
cd app-pilot && ./install     # writes this clone's path to ~/.app-pilot
```

Projects resolve the harness in this order:
1. `APP_PILOT_HOME` env var
2. `~/.app-pilot` — a one-line file containing the path (what `./install` writes)
3. `~/programming/projects/app-pilot` (fallback for pin-less clones at that path)

Machine prerequisites are checked (with a printed fix per FAIL) by
`app-pilot doctor` — mobile needs Xcode CLT + idb (`mobile/README.md`), web
needs the Playwright MCP in the project (`web/README.md`).

## Onboard a project (minutes)

1. Copy the shim: `templates/shim-mobile` → `<project>/scripts/app-pilot/app-pilot`
   (or `templates/shim-web` → `<project>/scripts/app-pilot/app-pilot`), `chmod +x`; copy
   `templates/_harness.py` next to it.
2. Copy `mobile/target.example.py` (or `web/`) next to it as `target.py` and
   edit its CONFIG section — values only; the machinery (sim auto-resolve,
   the `--field` CLI) comes from `common/targetkit.py` via `_harness.py`.
3. Gitignore `runs/`, `target.local`, `__pycache__/` in that dir.
4. Optional: add `product/` (start from `templates/product-README.md`) and
   `ext/`.
5. Smoke test: `app-pilot doctor` → `app-pilot serve` → `app-pilot health` → (mobile) `app-pilot tree`.

PORTING.md has the full recipe plus the empirical gotchas that cost a day
each if rediscovered.

## Quickstart — driving it

Two ways to operate a project once it's onboarded.

**1. Missions (the agent is the brain).** A project installs a ~10-line launcher
at `.claude/commands/app-pilot.md`; invoke missions through it:

```
/app-pilot <mission> [wake|goal] <request>
```

| Mission | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bug-hunt` | Drives screens/flows on the live app; logs navigation/layout/crash/interaction bugs. `report-only`, or fix mode (fixes + opens a PR). |
| `scenario-exec` | Executes a scripted scenario corpus, report-only. |
| `feature-dev` | Builds a feature from a spec (code-producing). |
| `improvement` | Works an improvement backlog (code-producing). |

`wake` (agent self-paces via its own scheduling) or `goal` (you paste a `/goal`
line) selects the driver — default `wake`. Examples:

```
/app-pilot bug-hunt report-only <scope> for 30m    # find bugs, no code changes
/app-pilot bug-hunt wake <scope> for 1h             # autonomous, self-paced
/app-pilot scenario-exec report-only <selection>    # run a scripted corpus
/app-pilot improvement report-only <backlog-path>   # triage a backlog
```

**2. Raw engine verbs (the agent's eyes & hands).** Run the project shim
(`scripts/app-pilot/app-pilot <verb>`) directly for ad-hoc work — the agent uses
these under the hood. `app-pilot help` lists them all; run `app-pilot doctor` first.

- **Lifecycle:** `doctor` · `serve` · `health` · `status` · `recover` · `reload` · `logs` · `crashes` · `stop`
- **Inspect / drive:** `tree` · `shot <label>` · `tap` · `type` · `scroll` · `find` · `target`
- **Ground truth:** `check` (assert the project's invariants) · `snapshot`/`diff` (state deltas around an action)
- **Evidence:** `publish` (host a QA screenshot off-branch for a PR)
- **Code review:** `review` — the pre-PR **second QA axis**: shells out to the
  standalone [`ensemble-ai`](https://github.com/oskarleonard/ensemble-ai) CLI to
  cross-vendor review the branch diff, so a PR is *born reviewed* (behavior verdict
  + code findings in one run trail at `runs/<run>/review/`). Opt-in per project via
  a `REVIEW` dict in `target.py`; degrades cleanly if `ensemble-ai` isn't installed.

A project can add its own named shims next to the launcher (e.g. a Figma
fidelity check, or a watchdog that re-fires a loop on a cron) — but the launcher
already reaches every mission, so a new mission needs no new command file.

## Rules of the repo

- **Nothing product-specific lands here.** Litmus test for every line:
  *would this still make sense for a completely different app?* App names,
  URLs, scope lists, invariant rules, Figma nodes → the project's `product/`.
- **Fix here, not in a project.** If a bug is found mid-QA-run in some
  project, the fix belongs in this repo (commit + push), so every other
  project inherits it.
- Engines per platform stay separate (`mobile/` vs `web/` — different
  mechanics); genuinely shared code goes to `common/`.
